// Package queue implements all the queue handling with tsuru. It abstracts
// which queue server is being used, how the message gets marshaled in to the
// wire and how it's read.
//
// It provides a basic type: Message. You can Put, Get, Delete and Release
// messages, using methods and functions with respective names.
//
// It also provides a generic, thread safe, handler for messages, with start
// and stop capability.
