Installing

Blockade can be installed via ``pip`` or ``easy_install``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install blockade

Because Blockade directly executes ``iptables`` and ``tc`` commands, it must
be installed on a Linux system or VM and run as root.

If you are using OSX, Blockade and Docker cannot yet be truly run natively.
Use the included ``Vagrantfile`` or another approach to get Docker and
Blockade installed into a Linux VM. If you have `Vagrant`_ installed, running
``vagrant up`` from the Blockade checkout directory should get you started.
Note that this may take a while, to download needed VMs and Docker containers.
