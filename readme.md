# Shipyard
Shipyard is a web UI for http://docker.io

To run the latest version on port 8000:

`docker run -p :8000 ehazlett/shipyard`

Or to run on a custom port (leave the `-p` option off to get random port):

`docker run -p 8005:8000 ehazlett/shipyard`

* `python manage.py runserver`
* `python manage.py rqworker shipyard` (in another terminal)
* Open browser to http://localhost:8000
* Add a host (i.e. 127.0.0.1 for local docker)

# Features

* Build Images (via uploaded Dockerfile or URL)
